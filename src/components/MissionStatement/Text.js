                <p className='railwayMedium'>Playing for our varsity tennis team for 3 years, we understand that high school tennis is a very expensive investment. It is no secret that winning against high-level players and maintaining a starter position on the high school varsity team requires consistent private lessons as well as attending numerous clinics. With private lessons averaging $60 an hour and clinics being as expensive, many athletes are pressured to perform exceptionally. This pressure in addition to the time commitment in being part of the tennis team heavily discourages players when they do not meet expectations. As a consequence, Tarun and I have witnessed many team members, both JV and Varsity, quit the tennis team during our tennis seasons.
